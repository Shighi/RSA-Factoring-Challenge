RSA-Factoring-Challenge
This repository contains two programs:

factors: Factorizes numbers from a file into two smaller factors (not necessarily primes).
rsa: Factorizes RSA numbers into two prime factors.
Usage
To run the programs:

bash

./factors <file>
./rsa <file>
Each <file> should contain one number per line for factors, or one RSA number for rsa. The output format is n=p*q.
